### Hi there, thanks for stopping by!

I am Stoyan from Bulgaria!

While primarily committed to shipping business and international trade I just recently found myself in the vast world of coding and software development, the journey itself started with Python just a few months ago in July 2022 and it has been quite a ride ever since.
